# What is the general steps involved in Machine Learing?

A general machine learning project contains the following steps:

  - Define a problem that you want to solve by machine learning
  - Prepare data to solve your machine learning problem
  - Evaluate algorithm that tests a wide different machine learning algorithm
  - Improve your result by keep tunning your result
  - Show your result

A diagram is shown below.

After you finish the general steps to obtain a machine learning model, you can apply the model into practice.
