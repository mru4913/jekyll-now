title: Which neighbourhood should we move to in Vancouver?
---

# 1. Introduction

Vancouver is undoubtedly one of the best places in the world to live, which is made up of a great number of communities and neighbourhoods. For people who decide to be residents in Vancouver, they often ask themselves which neighbourhood is the best and where can purchase or rent a condo at a reasonable price. However, deciding to which neighbourhood to live in Vancouver can take a while. Beyond personal lifestyle and individual preferences, we could all agree on that a good urban neighbourhood will be safe, affordable and reliable, as well as provide lots of public facilities and plenty of green spaces.

__So which neighbourhood should we move to in Vancouver?__

There are 6 communities that are close to English Bay we are realistically considering in this blog.

> 1. Downtown
> 2. West End
> 3. Kitsilano
> 4. West Point Grey
> 5. Fairview
> 6. Mount Pleasant

It is still quite a variety here. To decide which neighbourhood we should move to, we will further explore in this blog to help us make the decision based on the following qualifiers.

> 1. Number of crimes
> 2. Average condo prices
> 3. Number of schools
> 4. Number of hospitals
> 5. Access to green spaces

# 2. Safety

### 2.1 The number of crimes in neighbourhoods

Safety in a neighbourhood is always one of the most important concerns, which is strongly associated with achieving a positive state of mental and physical well being among residents within social environments.

In order to compare the safety, we start with the number of crimes made in each neighbourhood in Vancouver. A dataset is obtained from *City of Vancouver Open Data Catalogue* [Crimes all years in Vancouver (CSV)](https://data.vancouver.ca/datacatalogue/crime-data.htm). The dataset consists of various kind of crimes reported to the Vancouver Police Department from 2015 to the recent. Each crime data comes with its longitude and latitude so that we can plot them into a scatter plot to reflect the density of crimes in certain areas.

  <a href="https://data.vancouver.ca/datacatalogue/crime-data.htm"> source</a>

</div>

From the figure (__Figure 2__), the highest concentration of crimes in Vancouver is more likely to be in the central business district or downtown. Meanwhile, West Point Grey has a lower density of crimes. However, it is not obvious for us to visualize the number of crimes in each community. Then we can plot a bar chart to help us.

  <p><em>Figure 3. The number of crimes in each neighbourhood</em></p>

  <a href="https://data.vancouver.ca/datacatalogue/crime-data.htm"> source</a>

</div>

The chart (__Figure 3__) shows a wide variation in the number of crimes made in 6 neighbourhoods. Downtown (CBD) has the largest number of crimes from 2015 to the recent, which is about 35,000, followed by West End with 10,000 crimes. West Point Grey has the least amount of crimes. The number of crimes in the rest neighbourhoods is close.


# 3. Housing Affordability

### 3.1 The average condo price per ft^2 in neighbourhoods

As the expansion of population and globalization, living in Vancouver is becoming expensive. Hence, finding a place to live in with limited cost should be wise and perspicacious. As individuals, we may begin with looking for a less-expensive place that requires less maintenance but provides access to amenities such as gym and concierge. A condo seems to be a good option.

<div align="middle">

</div>

As shown from the chart (__Figure 4__), the overall average price per square feet of condo appears upward trend over the period from 2009 to 2018. In 2018, Downtown leads other neighbourhoods in the average price per square feet, with CAD$1,100 per ft^2. West End comes second, with about CAD$1,000. Mount Pleasant tends to have the lowest average price per square feet among those communities.


# 4. Education and Medical Service

### 4.1 Access to schools

Education and medical services are fundamental to the stability and social well-being of a community.

One important indicator for determining where to live in is probably the number of schools in each area. A large number of schools in a neighbourhood is of great benefit to families with children because it provides more educational opportunities that allow the children to choose the most suitable one. Based on the dataset that is provided by [the BC Ministry of Education](https://data.vancouver.ca/datacatalogue/schools.htm), we can visualize the schools' locations on the Google Map.

<div align="middle">

  <img src="./img/schools_map.png"/>
  <p><em>Figure 5. The schools' location on Google Map</em></p>

  <a href="http://vanmapp1.vancouver.ca/gmaps/covmap_data.htm?map=schools.kmz&data=1">source</a>

</div>

<div align="middle">

  <p><em>Figure 6. The number of schools in each neighbourhood</em></p>

  <a href="http://vanmapp1.vancouver.ca/gmaps/covmap_data.htm?map=schools.kmz&data=1">source</a>

</div>

It can be seen in the chart that there are 13 schools in Kitsilano. This quantity is four times as many as that in West End.  West Point Grey, Downtown and Mount Pleasant have a similar number of schools that is 6.  Fairview has 6 schools.

### 4.2 Access to hospitals

Many families and we are concerned about a living residence that is in proximity to a hospital because the closer the residence is to the hospital, the more likely their loved one is to receive emergency care or medical service in time. It is critical to know whether there is a hospital located within the neighbourhood they live in.

<div align="middle">

  <img src="./img/hospital.png"/>
  <p><em>Figure 7. The hospitals' locations on Google Map</em></p>

  <a href="https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/bc-health-care-facilities-hospital">source</a>

</div>


<div align="middle">

  <img src="./img/hospital_table.png"/>
  <p><em>Table 1. Whether a neighbourhood has a hospital?</em></p>

</div>

We create a table (__Table 1__) to show the research result based on what is shown on the Google Map. That is a "YES" for the neighbourhood with a hospital and a "No" for the one that has no hospital. Three neighbourhoods have hospitals to provide immediate health care services. They are West End, Fairview, and Mount Pleasant, which owns one hospital respectively.

# 5. Surrounding Living Condition

### 5.1 Access to green spaces

Access to green spaces such as open spaces and parks appears to benefit both physical and mental health by increasing levels of physical activities and reducing pressure levels. These spaces make it easy for people to walk, cycle, join in recreational events, and interact with others within their neighbourhood. Therefore, we should take the access to green spaces as an indicator of picking the best neighbourhood.

There are many different methods to measure green spaces. One of them is to look at open spaces per capita that give a basic idea of the amount of green space a person can enjoy in a neighbourhood.

<div align="middle">

  <img src="./img/green_space.png"/>
  <p><em>Figure 8. Vancouver open space per capita</em></p>

  <a href="http://vancouverpublicspace.ca/2017/07/14/getting-to-the-bottom-of-vancouvers-green-spaces-a-review-of-green-space-metrics/">source</a>

<div align="middle">

  <img src="./img/green_space_chart.png"/>
  <p><em>Figure 9. The hectares per person in each neighbourhood</em></p>

  <a href="http://vancouverpublicspace.ca/2017/07/14/getting-to-the-bottom-of-vancouvers-green-spaces-a-review-of-green-space-metrics/">source</a>

</div>

From the chart (__Figure 9__),  people who live in West End enjoy the largest open space per capita while people in Mount Pleasant are served by the least amount of green space.

# 6. Evaluation

We know which neighbourhood is the best within each qualifier.  For example,  West Point Grey has the least number of crimes which implies it is the safest one among those neighbourhoods, but it has no hospital. We do not want to compare them factor by factor.  We create a scoring system to evaluate the overall performance of each neighbourhood to ensure the one we select is the best.

Every neighbourhood initially has ten points within each qualifier. According to the neighbourhood's performance and ranking (from 1 to 6), they may suffer point deduction. The following is an example.

In terms of access to education, Kitsilano has the largest number of schools and provides the most education opportunities so that it ranks the first in that qualifier. It takes 1 point deduction. Downtown, West Point Grey and Mount Pleasant have the same quantity of schools and tie for the second place. In this situation, the points deduction is the average of the sum of points for the second, third and fourth positions ((2+3+4)/3 = 3). Three points from each of them. Fairview comes the fifth and has 5 points off. West End remains at the bottom.

<div align="middle">

  <img src="./img/example_points.png"/>
  <p><em>Figure 9. The hectares per person in each neighbourhood</em></p>

</div>

With regarding to hospital qualifier, it gets 10 points if a neighbourhood has a hospital. Otherwise, it gets 5 points.

BaseBased on the above, we calculate the overall performance of each neighbourhood by adding all the scores together. However, some qualifiers appear to be more valuable than others. For example,   my priority is safety so that I tend to add more weight to safety qualifier. We then add weights to each qualifier based on my  perspective.

<div align="middle">

  <img src="./img/equation.png"/>

</div>

We then calculate the individual score of each neighbourhood and plot them in a chart.

<div align="middle">

  <img src="./img/overall.png"/>

</div>

<div align="middle">

  <img src="./img/score.png"/>
  <p><em>Figure 10. The overall score of each neighbourhood</em></p>

</div>

According to the scoring system we designed,  West Point Grey is the best neighbourhood that we should move to in Vancouver, with a final score of 7.55/10.  It is not surprising that West Point Grey won because we attach more importance to safety and it is the safest neighbourhood in all our choices. Kitsilano comes second with 7.25. Fairview is the third choice, narrowly beating Mount Pleasant into fourth place. Downtown is the last choice with a score of 5 mainly due to a high concentration of crimes.

If you want to move to Vancouver and consider the above six neighbourhoods, West Point Grey maybe your first choice.
